## General info
This project, Ragnarök, is more than just a game; it's a journey designed for professional growth, 
deeply interwoven with its narrative. My primary goal is to gain practical experience in game development, honing skills across various 
disciplines by bringing this unique vision to life.
The game's narrative is particularly significant as it's told entirely from the perspective of a character with a disability. 
This approach aims to offer players a distinct and empathetic experience, challenging conventional viewpoints and fostering a deeper 
understanding of diverse perspectives within the interactive medium.
The project is being developed specifically for Microsoft Windows, leveraging the platform's capabilities to deliver an engaging and 
accessible experience.
